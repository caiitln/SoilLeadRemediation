          <div class="md:flex">
            <div class="text-xl">
              <p>Lead is one of the most harmful toxins in the environment. Its presence persists in soil despite
                decades
                of
                regulation on the metal. Soil is a major source of lead exposure for people today. This comes from soil
                trailing into homes as house dust coupled with kids’ tendency to play in and ingest soil (Laidlaw et
                al.,
                2017). Remediating lead-contaminated soil is urgently needed, since exposure to low concentrations of
                lead
                could result in adverse health effects due to bioaccumulation.</p>
              <p>Previous data show that after soil remediation in yards, the amount of lead in the blood of surrounding
                residents, especially children, is substantially reduced. The hindrance of removing lead from soil is
                that
                this process is typically expensive and labor-intensive, giving it the reputation as being impractical.
                It
                is
                even less practical for low-income families residing in urban areas, even though their lead exposure
                risk
                is
                higher (Kraft and Scheberle, 1995).</p>
              <p>Developed through research funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, a new
                technology called chelate-assisted phytoremediation presents a possible
                solution
                to
                this problem. It involves planting vetiver grass in one’s yard. This grass has a massive root system
                that
                can
                absorb lead from the soil and prevent as much soil from becoming house dust. A biodegradable substance,
                ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS), is sprayed on the soil to facilitate plant absorption of the
                lead.
                In
                this paper, the need for soil lead remediation, traditional remediation methods, and most importantly
                the
                phytoremediation approach will be presented as an introduction to and reference for soil lead
                remediation
                in
                residential areas. </p>

                <p>While lead is well known for having caused contamination through mining, smelters, batteries, paint,
                  and
                  gasoline (Kerr and Newell, 2003; Laidlaw et al., 2017; Kushwaha et al., 2018), less attention tends to
                  be
                  paid to soil as a source of contamination (Mielke et al., 2007). Soil has become ridden with lead
                  after
                  being widely used for much of history (Laidlaw et al., 2017). Despite popular uses of lead being
                  banned
                  decades ago, the properties of lead allow it to survive in soil for centuries (Kerr and Newell, 2003;
                  Schwarz et al., 2012). In residential areas, lead-based paint in house dust and soils has been
                  identified
                  as
                  a persistent source of lead poisoning. Urban soil has been referred to as a sink for lead (Mielke et
                  al.,
                  2007; Schwarz et al., 2012).</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class='md:-mt-16'>Like with soil, lead is not eliminated from the body quickly. Even exposure to lead in
              low
              quantities
              builds up over time (Gürer et al., 2001). There is almost no function in the body that is not negatively
              affected by lead. High levels of lead significantly disrupt the functions of the digestive system, nervous
              system, respiratory system, reproductive system, enzymes, DNA transcription, and bones, etc. (Ab Latif
              Wani
              et al., 2015).</p>

                <p>Recently, more interest lies within the effects of low levels of lead. As more studies revealed
                  majorly
                  harmful effects of low levels of lead, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) continuously decreased
                  the
                  amount they considered the standard limit for blood lead levels (BLLs). Since 2012, the CDC’s limit is
                  to
                  be
                  below 5 μg/dL for children and below 10 μg/dL for adults (CDC, 2021; Ab Latif Wani et al., 2015). 5
                  μg/dL
                  means that for every deciliter of blood, there are 5 micrograms of lead present. To put that into
                  perspective, 5 micrograms is just a fraction of what a single eyelash would weigh, while a deciliter
                  is
                  a
                  bit less than half a cup of liquid. That said, no amount of lead in the body, not even such low ones,
                  is
                  considered safe (USDH-NTP, 2012).</p>
                <p>In 2012, the United States Department of Health’s National Toxicology Program produced a review of
                  the
                  impacts of BLLs below the CDC limits (USDH-NTP, 2012). The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
                  Registry
                  published a similar review in 2020 (ATSDR, 2020). Each of these gather data from international studies
                  on
                  the effects of low BLLs on humans in order to highlight the most reliable and consistent results.

            <p>Lead in residential soil is ingested by children and inhaled by both children and adults (Figure 1).
              Adults
              and
              children inhale lead when the soil lead enters the home and becomes house dust (Lanphear and Roghmann,
              1997;
              Bornschein et al., 1991). Soil lead can be tracked into the house on shoes or even by pets (Hunt and
              Johnson,
              2012; Brunekreef et al., 1987). Children pick up and ingest soil more frequently due to their tendency to
              crawl
              on the ground, play with soil, and touch their mouths (Viverette et al., 1996). This, combined with the
              fact
              that children’s bodies are rapidly developing, puts them at a significantly higher risk to have elevated
              BLLs
              (USDH-NTP, 2012).</p>

              et al., 2003; Aschengrau et al., 1994; Weitzman et al., 1993). Studies have shown that when lead in soil
              is
              remediated, the lead levels of house dust and the BLLs of residents decrease (Mielke et al., 2007; Lindern

                  C

                <p>A seemingly obvious way to remediate lead-contaminated soil would be to replace the soil in a yard
                  with
                  clean soil, however this is impractical for a variety of reasons. This method is known as excavation,
                  or
                  off-site disposal. Disposing of contaminated soil elsewhere is not only expensive and labor-intensive;
                  it
                  requires having a source to legally dump massive amounts of contaminated soil onto and a source of
                  clean
                  soil to take from (Hettiarachchi and Pierzynski, 2004; Diamond et al., 2009; Laidlaw et al., 2017). It
                  is
                  unrealistic for homeowners to accomplish, negatively disrupts the local environment, and does nothing
                  to
                  actually reduce the volume or toxicity of lead present in the environment as a whole (Royer et al.,
                  1992;
                  Hettiarachchi and Pierzynski, 2004).</p>

              What
              makes
              these physical
              methods different and not actually ideal is that they do not set out to ‘fix’ the soil, they only change
              how
              people use their yards. This involves placing stone pathways on frequently walked areas, relocating play
              areas
              to less contaminated parts of the yard, or installing raised beds of clean soil for gardening, playing, or
              eating outside (Hynes et al., 2001; Litt et al., 2002).</p>
            <div class="md:flex">
              <div>
                <p>While these methods may be favorable in contrast to other pricey options, they do not offer true
                  solutions
                  and are not actually what many homeowners would consider ‘cheap’. One study using this method found
                  that
                  the
                  average cost per yard was about $2,100, not including the price of materials donated by local
                  companies
                  for
                  the sake of the project or any overhead costs (Hynes et al., 2001).</p>
                <p>Additionally, it is unclear whether raised beds of clean soil are even able to resist becoming
                  contaminated
                  overtime; one study has shown that they become recontaminated (Clark et al., 2008). Replacing the top
                  few
                  inches of soil with clean soil in entire yards has also been used as an ‘affordable’ intervention.
                  This
                  resulted in recontamination after the hefty price of $9,600 per yard (Aschengrau et al., 1994).</p>

            <p>A chemical option with many cons similar to that of the excavation method is soil washing. This consists
              of
              first transporting the soil to a facility, and then putting it through a series of actions that clean it
              of
              its
              contaminated parts so that the same soil can be filled into the yard again (Diamond et al., 2009; Laidlaw
              et
              al., 2017). </p>

                <p>In theory, remediating soil without having to move it from the yard can make for more feasible
                  methods
                  for
                  homeowners. That said, the options for treating soil in place tend to be inaccessible to the general
                  public.
                  For
                  instance, lead in soil can be solidified or stabilized, making it less bioavailable, or accessible for
                  the
                  human
                  body to take in. This often requires injecting proprietary additives into the soil or using
                  complicated,
                  inaccessible equipment (Royer et al., 1992).</p>
                <p>Using chemicals, specifically phosphorus, to stabilize the lead in soil is overall one of the least
                  expensive options (Basta and McGowen, 2004). A study verifying a positive impact on residents has not
                  yet
                  been done (Laidlaw et al., 2017). This method has some dependence on being able to control certain
                  environmental factors; real-life settings such as residential yards can thus make this method more
                  difficult
                  to implement (Scheckel et al., 2013).</p>

                phytoremediation attractive: it is visually unobtrusive and really inexpensive. The only cheaper

                —Dr. Dibyendu Sarkar, Stevens Institute of Technology</p>
            </div>
            <p>All hope is not lost, though. There is another strategy for remediating soil that has been proving itself
              to
              hold up better in terms of cost, accessibility, ease of use, and sustainability: phytoremediation.
              Phytoremediation uses plants as a solution to contaminated soil. Phytoremediation for lead contaminated
              soil
              involves two techniques: phytoextraction and phytostabilization.</p>
            <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
              <img src='graphics/Phytoextraction vs Phytostabilization (1).png' />
              <p class="caption">Figure 3: Phytoextraction vs. Phytostabilization</p>
            </div>
            <p>Phytostabilization is when a plant makes the lead less mobile or available for humans to uptake it. This
              can
              translate to a reduction in house dust lead levels, since less soil is being brought into the home as
              dust.
              For
              phytoextraction, on the other hand, plants remove lead from soil by acting like sponges (Figure 3). The
              roots
              of
              the plant soak up lead surrounding it like a sponge would with water. Eventually, lead is transported up
              to
              the
              leaves and is stored in the roots and leaves of the plant, which can be harvested and disposed of.
              Phytoextraction outcompetes phytostabilization in removing lead from soil rather than fixing it in the
              soil
              (Figure 3).</p>
            <p>Of course, not just any plant lends itself to phytoremediation. The plant must be able to tolerate high
              levels
              of lead, as well as survive in a variety of soil conditions and climates. Other ideal characteristics
              include
              being a plant that grows quickly, is high in mass, has an extensive root system, and is easy to harvest
              (Datta
              and Sarkar, 2004).</p>

              </div>
              <div>
                <p>Based on those measures, vetiver grass is an ideal candidate for phytoremediation. Vetiver grows
                  quickly
                  and reaches heights of about 1-2 yards, while its root system is massive and complex, growing to be
                  about
                  3-4 yards long (Truong 2000). This large root system makes vetiver ideal for preventing soil erosion
                  since
                  it holds the soil particles together (Danh et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2000). </p>
                <p>Vetiver is highly tolerant of extreme climatic conditions, including drought, flood, and temperatures
                  from
                  -4°F to 131°F (Danh et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2000). Most importantly, it is also highly tolerant of
                  metals
                  in soil, including lead, and can adapt to a variety of soil conditions (Danh et al., 2009; Chen et
                  al.,
                  2000).</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="md:flex">
              <div>
                <p>Although vetiver has been proven to accumulate around 19,800 mg/kg of lead in water (Andra et al.,
                  2009),
                  it can only uptake (or remove) the amount of lead that is available to it. When lead is available for
                  plant
                  uptake, it is considered soluble. The portion of soluble lead in soil is considerably low (Andra et
                  al.,
                  2010). Thus, additives known as chelating agents are used to increase lead solubility (Andra et al.,
                  2009;
                  Attiniti et al., 2017). In other words, a substance is added to the soil that makes it easier for the
                  plant
                  to uptake more lead.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>It is important that the added substance does not compromise one of the major pros of phytoremediation:
              being safe and sustainable for the soil and environment. Some chelating agents are more effective at
              increasing plant uptake than others but are not as sustainable (Attiniti et al., 2017). Thus, they are not
              good candidates for phytoremediation. Among all chelating agents, ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) is
              an effective one due to being effective and environmentally-friendly (Attiniti et al., 2017; Sarkar et
              al., 2008). It is biodegradable, which decays in soil naturally in a short time.</p>
            <p>The research team of Prof. Dibyendu Sarkar at Stevens Institute of Technology has proved the
              effectiveness of EDDS in helping vetiver uptake more lead, making EDDS a great option for assisting lead
              phytoextraction. Phase I of this research began in 2004, funded by the United States Department of Housing
              and Urban Development’s (HUD’s) Lead Technical Studies Grant Program (HUD LTS – TXLHT0102-04). EDDS was
              tested in phytoremediation in a controlled greenhouse setting. Once this was successful, HUD provided more
              funding in 2010 for Phase II (NJLHT0107-10). The team conducted field experiments using soil boxes in
              natural conditions.</p>
            <p>It was not until after Phase II was proven successful that the team was able to begin testing in real
              resident’s yards in Jersey City and San Antonio. This is Phase III of the project (funded by HUD with
              MILTS0007-17) and has been underway since 2017, set to be finished this year. Within just two years, most
              of the yards have been “cleaned” with their lead soil concentrations all the way down to being below
              400mg/Kg.</p>
            <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
              <img class='w-1/3' src="graphics/Step by Step Phytoremediation.png" />
              <p class="caption">Figure 4: Major steps in the phytoremediation process for residents</p>
            </div>
            <p>To complete phytoremediation in an actual yard (Figure 4), the first step would be determining where the
              treatment would be most helpful. Typically, this would be in the contaminated parts of the yard with lead
              concentrations higher than the USEPA soil Pb hazard cutoff value of 400 mg/kg for soil in children’s play
              areas.
              Although it is visually unobtrusive, vetiver grass could grow too tall to easily walk through. If a
              homeowner
              wanted to remediate all of the soil in a yard, it would be best to do so in sections (completing one
              before
              starting another), since the vetiver will be completely removed after treatment is complete.</p>
            <p>The vetiver, which is grown off-site, can be planted into the chosen area of the yard. The chelating
              agent,
              EDDS, can then be applied in the same method one would apply a spray-on fertilizer. EDDS is not a
              hazardous substance to handle. If there is no rain,
              the
              homeowner only needs to water the vetiver grass to keep it growing. </p>
            <div class="flex justify-center">
              <p class="callout text-2xl">Thus, the residents are already better off just from planting the vetiver
                before
                any
                lead is
                taken up.</p>
            </div>
            <p>During the phytoremediation process, the vetiver grass roots can hold soil in place and prevent it from
              becoming house dust. Thus, the residents are already better off just from planting the vetiver before any
              lead
              is taken up. Still, the bigger and safer goal is to have the lead ultimately removed from the soil. Soil
              samples
              may be tested to track the removal process of lead in the soil. Once the lead levels have reduced to safe
              levels, the vetiver may be removed and the treatment is complete. The length of time it takes to reach
              this
              point varies greatly depending on soil conditions, the climate, and other uncontrollable factors.
              Quantifications of lead concentrations in soil and application of EDDS could be consulted by Prof.
              Dibyendu
              Sarkar’s research team at Stevens Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p>Overall, the planting and maintenance of the grass is straightforward and requires only a few basic
              gardening
              tools. It is clear that phytoremediation is more feasible than any other soil treatment method, especially
              for
              homeowners.</p>
